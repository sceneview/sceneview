/// (`cameraPosition()`, `lookOrientation()`, `sceneRotation()` and the constant
/// root reset all read only from this set), so an unchanged snapshot means the
/// entity transform would be rewritten with identical values — the write can be
/// skipped. Compared with ``approximatelyMatches(_:)`` (float tolerance), never
/// `==`, because the values are derived geometry. Closes #2331.

/// Extracted from the `private` `SceneViewRepresentation` to a top-level

/// (e.g. dropping the `mode` exact-compare, loosening `eps`, or skipping the
/// nil ↔ non-nil `firstPersonEye` check). Mirrors the #2313 ``EntityDragState``
