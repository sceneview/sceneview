/// reverting `current − previous` → `current`, dropping the `.onEnded` reset, or
/// mis-keying the dictionary). Routing the gesture through these `internal`
/// pure-ish functions lets the tests drive the **same** code the gesture runs.

/// `SceneView`'s `@State` value and so never invalidate the SwiftUI body /
