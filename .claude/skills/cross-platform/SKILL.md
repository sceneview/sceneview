description: The cross-platform architecture — KMP shares LOGIC, never rendering; Filament on Android, RealityKit on Apple; the supported-platform matrix and status, sceneview-core's shared surface, the iOS consumption paths (SPM, Flutter PlatformView, RN Fabric, KMP UIKitView), and the phased plan. Use when adding an API to one platform, assessing cross-platform parity, or answering why Filament is not used on Apple.

## Cross-platform strategy

### Architecture: native renderer per platform

     Compose UI        SwiftUI (native)
                       Flutter (PlatformView)
                       React Native (Fabric)
                       KMP Compose (UIKitView)
```

**Key decision:** KMP shares **logic** (math, collision, geometry, animations), not **rendering**.
Each platform uses its native renderer: Filament on Android, RealityKit on Apple.

Rationale:
- RealityKit is the only path to visionOS spatial computing
- Swift Package integration (1 line SPM) vs KMP XCFramework (opaque binary, poor DX)
- SceneViewSwift is consumable by any iOS framework (Flutter, React Native, KMP Compose)
- No Filament dependency on Apple = smaller binary, native debugging, native tooling

### Supported platforms

| Platform | Renderer | Framework | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Android | Filament | Jetpack Compose | Stable (v3.3.0) |
| Android TV | Filament | Compose TV | Alpha (sample app) |
| Android XR | Jetpack XR SceneCore | Compose XR | Planned |
| iOS | RealityKit | SwiftUI | Alpha (v3.3.0) |
| macOS | RealityKit | SwiftUI | Alpha (v3.3.0, in Package.swift) |
| visionOS | RealityKit | SwiftUI | Alpha (v3.3.0, in Package.swift) |
| Web | Filament.js (WASM) | Kotlin/JS | Alpha (sceneview-web + WebXR) |
| Desktop | Wireframe placeholder (not SceneView) | Compose Desktop | Placeholder (Filament JNI not available) |
| Flutter | Filament / RealityKit | PlatformView | Alpha (bridge implemented) |
| React Native | Filament / RealityKit | Fabric | Alpha (bridge implemented) |

### KMP core role

`sceneview-core/` targets `android`, `iosArm64`, `iosSimulatorArm64`, `iosX64` with shared:
- Collision system (Ray, Box, Sphere, Intersections)
- Triangulation (Earcut, Delaunator)
- Geometry generation (Cube, Sphere, Cylinder, Plane, Path, Line, Shape)
- Animation (Spring, Property, Interpolation, SmoothTransform)
- Physics simulation
- Scene graph, math utilities, logging

SceneViewSwift can consume this as an XCFramework for shared algorithms,
while keeping RealityKit as the rendering backend.

### Cross-framework iOS consumption

| Framework | Integration method |
|---|---|
| Swift native | `import SceneViewSwift` via SPM |
| Flutter | Plugin with `PlatformView` wrapping `SceneView`/`ARSceneView` |
| React Native | Turbo Module / Fabric component bridging to SceneViewSwift |
| KMP Compose | `UIKitView` in Compose iOS wrapping the underlying UIView |

### Phased plan (revised)

| Phase | Scope | Complexity |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — SceneViewSwift stabilization | Complete 3D+AR API, add macOS target, tests, docs | Medium |
| 2 — KMP core consumption | Build XCFramework from sceneview-core, integrate into SceneViewSwift | Medium |
| 3 — Cross-framework bridges | Flutter plugin, React Native module | Medium |
| 4 — visionOS spatial | Immersive spaces, hand tracking, spatial anchors | High |
| 5 — Docs & website | Update all docs/README/site for multi-platform (iOS, macOS, visionOS) | Low |
