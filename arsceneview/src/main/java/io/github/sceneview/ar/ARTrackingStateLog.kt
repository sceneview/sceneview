/**
 * Turns the camera's per-frame tracking state into one log line per **transition**, repeated
 * every [REPEAT_NANOS] for as long as the camera is not tracking (#4510).
 *
 * A session that delivers camera images but never reaches `TRACKING` used to leave nothing in
 * logcat: `onTrackingFailureChanged` only reports a non-`NONE` reason, so a camera sitting in
 * `PAUSED` with reason `NONE` was silent. One line per change — `NONE` included, never one per
 * frame — is enough to tell that case from a throwing frame loop.
 *
 * The repeat is what keeps the line readable later: ARCore writes some sixty lines a second from
 * the app's own process, so a line logged once when the session started has left a default
 * 256 KiB log buffer within a couple of minutes. A repeated line carries `for=<n>s`, the time the
 * state has lasted, which tells "never tracked" from "tracked, then lost it". A tracking camera
 * repeats nothing.
 *
 * Time is the caller's monotonic clock, not the camera image's timestamp: a session that stops
 * delivering new images keeps handing back the same frame with the same timestamp, and that is
 * one of the states this line has to keep reporting.
